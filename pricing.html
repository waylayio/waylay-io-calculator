    <p>Tenant price is 5$ per month.</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    Function is a service that runs your code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there is no charge when your code is not running. When you use functions, you pay for two different things: the number of requests and duration. The price for duration depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function and it is expressed in GB-second. In the current release, memory allocation is fixed to 128M, and you can’t change it. 
   </p>
   <h3>Example</h3>
   <p>
    If you execute a function 10 million times in one month, and it ran for 100ms each time, your charges would be calculated as follows:
    Monthly compute charges (1$ per million requests, $0.00002 per GB-s)

    Total compute (seconds) = 10M * (0.1sec) = 1,000,000 seconds
    Total compute (GB-s) = 1,000,000 * 128MB/1024 = 125,000 GB-s 

    Total price: 10$ + (125000 * $0.00002) = 10$ + 2.5$ = 12.5$
   </p>
  </div>
  <div id="task">
   <h2>Task transitions</h2>
   <p>
    Task transitions occur every time a task invocation infers that any other node needs to be executed as the result of a previous node execution.
    However, if the task has only one sensor, and that task runs periodically or as the cron expression, then the number of steps in that task will always be zero. Even if that task has multiple sensors, but these sensors are not connected, the number of steps for such a task will always be zero. 
   </p>
   <p>
    Example, if we have a reactive task that sends an email every time the threshold is crossed (for instance temperature reading for a sensor) and if that threshold is crossed on average twice a day, then the total number of task transitions per month will be:
    30days*2 conditions of the threshold crossing sensor triggered execution of * 1 sensor (email) = 60 steps = 60* 0.025$/1000 = 0.0015$
   </p>
   <h2>Task logs storage</h2>
   <p>The price is 5$ per 1GB of task logs stored.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="network">
   <h2>Network egress</h2>
   <p>
    Network egress is the outbound data transfer and it is priced at 0.15$ per GB. Inbound traffic is free. 
    Ingested Messages
    Ingested message is a payload that arrives at the Broker. The cost is 0.3$ per million messages.
   </p>
  </div> 
  <div id="converter">
   <h2>Converter calls</h2>
   <p>
    Each message payload can be processed by the velocity template prior to being sent to the Broker. The cost of converter calls is 1$ per million messages. 
   </p>
  </div> 
  <div id="time-series"> 
   <h2>Time series database metrics</h2>
   <p>
    Time series database will not be metered in the first release. Please note that the cost will be 25$ per 1GB per month.
   </p>
   <h3>TS write metrics</h3>
   <p>
    The cost of writing metrics in the time series database is 25$ per 15 million data points. For instance, if the message payload has 3 metrics, one message that is stored will result in 3 data points written. 
    Example:
    If you have 100 devices, each sending data every 15 minutes, and each payload has three metrics, in one month you will be paying:
    100 devices * 30 days * 96 messages per day * 3 metrics = 864000 data points. Price of time series storage would be 864000 * 25/15000000 = 1.45$
   </p>
   <h3>TS read scan</h3>
   <p>
    Every time you fetch data from the time series database (over UI or REST), Waylay meters the number of metrics scanned in the time series database. Please note that this is not the same as the number of returned metrics, in case your query uses the aggregates and grouping in your query.The cost is $0.06 per 100,000 metrics scanned. 
    Example: 
    If you ask for the temperature of one sensor over 1 week, and data is stored every 15 minutes, irrespectively whether  the query asks for all data or the aggregate, the read scan will be metered as: 7 days * 96 points = 672
    If you call this query 10 times a day, for 100 sensors, that would be in one month:
    100 sensors * 30 days * 10 times a day * 672 read scans = 20160000 scans and the total price would be
    20160000 * 0.06$/100000 = 12.1$
   </p>
  </div> 
  <div id="assets">  
   <h2>Assets</h2>
   <p>Asset is a resource, resource type or a resource constraint. The price is 0.2$ per 100 assets and it is metered at the end of the calendar month.</p>
   
  </div> 
  <div id="messages">
   <h2>Messages</h2>
   <p>
    The number of stream messages (payloads) entering in our system, regardless whether they are later stored or not. If stored, they will be present both in payload database, as well as in the metrics database, providing they come in the proper format. 
   </p>
  </div>
  <div id="payload">
   <h2>Payload database</h2>
   <p>
    Payload database holds up to 100 payload messages per resource. 
    Payload database size

   </p>
   <h3>Payload Object Read Scan</h3>

   </p>
  </div>
  <div id="resource">

   <p>
    Resource database holds metadata for resources (and all change logs), resource types and resource constraints. 
   </p>
   <h3>Resource database size</h3>
   <p>
    The cost of the database is 25$ per GB per month, measured at the end of the calendar month.
